# 06- Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

1. At first it seems pretty intimaditng seeing all this code and working with it. I like the ability to interact with the user and giving the user something to have to think about for a second. I feel it keeps them interested longer and willing to put in a bit of effort on their side just to see an outcome. 
2. I like the prompts but setting them up to look clean takes some work. I dont want them to look Windows 95 as how they do currently. But I will working with this project over the weekend and nezxt week just to get a better feel for the code.
